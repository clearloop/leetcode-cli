/*
 * Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:
 * 
 * 
 * 	[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
 * 	[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 * 
 * 
 * Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
 * 
 * Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.
 * 
 * You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
 * 
 *  
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5]
 * Output: 1
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
 * Output: 0
 * 
 *  
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 	n == nums.length
 * 	1 <= n <= 5000
 * 	-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
 * 	nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
 * 
 * 
 *  
 * Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
